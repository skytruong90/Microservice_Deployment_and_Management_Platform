# Python Script for Deploying Microservices on Kubernetes

This Python script simplifies the process of deploying microservices on a Kubernetes cluster. It utilizes the `kubectl` command-line tool to deploy and manage applications defined in YAML configuration files.

## Key Feature

### Automated Deployment
- Deploy microservices using Kubernetes YAML files through automated Python scripts.
- Handle basic deployment tasks such as creating, updating, and deleting resources.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `kubectl` installed and configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Ensure Python and `kubectl` are installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository containing the Python script and Kubernetes YAML configurations.

### Usage
Execute the Python script to deploy your microservice:

```bash
python deploy.py
```

### Explanation
- The script takes a list of YAML configuration files and uses `kubectl apply` to deploy each file to the Kubernetes cluster.
- Basic error handling is included to manage deployment failures.
